# Logs Directory

This directory contains application logs generated by the NSFW Detection Backend API.

## Log Files

- `app.log` - Main application log file
- `error.log` - Error-specific log file (if configured)
- `access.log` - HTTP access logs (if configured)

## Log Rotation

Logs are automatically rotated when they exceed the configured size limit (default: 10MB).
Old log files are archived with timestamps.

## Viewing Logs

To view logs in real-time:

```bash
npm run logs
```

Or manually:

```bash
tail -f logs/app.log
```

## Log Levels

- `error` - Error events that might still allow the application to continue running
- `warn` - Potentially harmful situations
- `info` - Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application
- `debug` - Fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application

## Configuration

Log settings can be configured in the `.env` file:

- `LOG_LEVEL` - Minimum log level to record
- `LOG_FILE` - Log file path
- `LOG_MAX_SIZE` - Maximum log file size before rotation
- `LOG_MAX_FILES` - Maximum number of log files to keep
